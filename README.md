***From DNAnexus R&D: examples using SciDB for scalable statistical analysis of geno+pheno datasets***

[SciDB](http://www.paradigm4.com/) is a scale-out DBMS designed for scientific use cases, with built-in capabilities for sophisticated mathematical calculations beyond the typical domain of SQL/NoSQL systems. These notebooks demonstrate using SciDB to work with genotype+phenotype datasets, including both simple aggregations and advanced calculations.
